Crisp Hack Summit
=================

Crisp Hack Summit is a 2-day event where we meet up at a off-site location and hack on pet projects and similar.

Hack Summit gives everyone an opportunity to:

-   learn and evaluate new technology
-   hear about other experiences of techniques and tools
-   try out ideas for products
-   focus on a task for 2 days
-   get to know each other, and people who wish to join Crisp
-   flee family chores ;)

Why is it called Crisp Hack Summit?
-----------------------------------

We like the combination of the slightly unserious "Hack" and the quite pretentious "Summit".

Purpose
-------

Part of our idea is to always keep learning new things, and to dedicate 20% of our time to personal development. The Hack Summit concept is part of this.
