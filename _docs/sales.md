# How we do sales

Most of our sales is lead or demand driven. That is, the most common scenario is that a new client contacts one of us directly or by e-mail after finding us via our website, some online content, being recommended us by a colleague or by some other form of word of mouth or reputation driven reason.

As a sales strategy, we believe that by making sure our reputation is at the top of the market we will ensure we have ample access to strong client opportunities. The way we [recruit](recruiting.md) is part of how we accomplish this in practice in combination with high [visibility](recruiting.md#How-we-make-ourselves-visible) and a generous attitude of sharing what we know.

Regarding the sales process itself, Crisp consultants typically sell themselves and each other.

However, even with a strong [brand](brand-building.html) we believe it is important to also have active sales support. As a contractor mainly focused on adding value to our clients, getting some high quality support with client contacts and agreements is something that many of us value. Not just for ourselves, but also as something that can add value to our customer experience. Therefore we offer active professional sales to crisp members as an opt in service through our [Sales Crisplet](sales.md#what-is-a-sales-crisplet-and-how-does-it-work), see below.

As a consultant or contractor, the timing of your next client can be a huge challenge. How likely is it that my next client, client B, will come knocking on the door precisely when I'm done with client A? Forget it! Instead, client B will get in touch while I'm still busy with client A. Or I'll finish with client A, and there's no other client knocking on the door. Consultants tend to have too much work or too little work, never just enough.

The solution is *load balancing* - having a group of trusted colleagues that you can send clients to and receive clients from allows us to pool our leads. And that's exactly what Crisp is - a bunch of trusted colleagues!

The [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) is our main tool for routing client requests between each other. It helps connect the right client with the right consultant at the right time, which benefits everyone! And it works pretty OK without any kind of central control :o)

How do we handle conflicts, such as two consultants competing for the same client gig?

See the [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) page for answers to that and many similar questions about how we route clients internally.

## Do we have a "finders fee" for finding client gigs for each other?

Nope. If you pass a client on to a colleague, you won't earn a provision or finder's fee or anything like that. Why? Because the underlying [purpose of Crisp](what-is-crisp.html) is not to accumulate profit at our collective level, it is to maximize [happiness](happiness-index.html). We earn money from our clients, not from each other.

> Once upon a time, we actually did have a finder's fee model. Each client had an "owner" (the person who was first contacted by the client, or the person who first started working with that client), and we had a spreadsheet to keep track of which consultant owned which client. If other consultants work with that client, they had to pay 10% of their revenue to the "owner". After a few years we realized that this model wasn't helping us at all. It was just causing a bunch of bureaucracy, sub-optimization, and confusion. Who "owns" a huge client like Ericsson? Do I still count as owner for client X if they get bought by client Y? Is ownership permanent or time-limited, and if so how do I "renew" it? Needless to say, we dumped the model many years ago and haven't missed it one bit. Instead the guiding principle is "what goes around, comes around". Today I give you a client, tomorrow someone else gives me a client, and over time it more or less evens out. 100% "fairness" just isn't worth pursuing.

## What is the Sales Crisplet, and how does it work?

The sales crisplet is an opt in service that any crisper can decide if they want to have access to. If you opt in, you get access to our sales professional. She is absolutely top notch!

Our strong reputation generates plenty of leads, typically in market segments where we are well established. Our active sales efforts are therefore focused on more emerging areas of the market that we may be proactively targeting because we find them attractive or as an area of future opportunity.

We are always [learning](building-competence.md) and therefore Crisp is always developing as well!

## What about the bun protocol and the sales crisplet, how do they work together?

Every member of crisp has access to the [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html), which is our main form of pooling leads. If you have opted into of the sales crisplet you get access to even more leads through our active sales professional and associated additional sales services.

## How does membership in the sales crisplet work, do I pay when I need a new client?

No. If you join the sales crisplet you pay in two ways, in part as a monthly flat fee and in part as a percentage of revenue billed. This means that you pay more when you have more income and less when you have less income.


## What power does the business developer have?

No formal powers at all! Although, like with all Crispers, there's plenty of *informal power* to go around :o)

In more typical consulting companies, sales people and business developers "own" their "resources" and can move and allocate them to clients as needed. At Crisp, however, we have no managers; people are people (not resources) and are free to do whatever they want! Since the business developer can't force anyone to do anything, she needs to work in close collaboration with the consultants. Basically, check with Jim before offering him to a client!

This makes the job a bit more complex, but the returns are very high, because [motivated consultants do a *much* better job](why-this-works.html).
