Economic Model
==============

The high level economic model is summarized in [How Product Space Works](how-Product Space-works.html). Here are some concrete examples to make it more clear.

Example: One month
------------------

Suppose Sandy is a Product Space consultant, and her current client is APNIC. Sandy's consulting fee is $150 per hour. And suppose the current Product Space fee is 10% + $5200/month.

1.  During January, Sandy does 100 hours of work for APNIC.
2.  At the end of January, Sandy adds one row to the invoicing spreadsheet (a single shared Google doc for everyone at Product Space), noting that APNIC should be invoiced $10,000 for January.
3.  The office team sends a $10,000 invoice from Product Space to APNIC, for Sandy's services.
4.  Sandy sends a $9,000 invoice from her personal company to Product Space ($10,000 minus the 10% Product Space "tax").

**Result for January:**
APNIC pays $10,000, Sandy earns $9,000, Product Space earns $1,000.

In addition, once per quarter Product Space will send a $1500 invoice to Sandy's company (3 x $200, the monthly fixed fee).

So let's put it all together.

Example: One year
-----------------

Suppose Sandy earns the same amount as above, every month for a year. In that case the net result is:

-   APNIC paid $120,000 for Sandy's services ($10,000 x 12 months)
-   Sandy earned $108,000 for her work at APNIC (90% of the income from APNIC)
-   Product Space earned $12,000 from Sandy's work at APNIC (10% of the income from APNIC)
-   In addition, Sandy paid $6000 to Product Space in fixed fees ($500 x 12 months)
-   **Result for the year:**
    -   APNIC: -$120,000
    -   Sandy: +$102,000
    -   Product Space: +$18,000

Example: hitting the ceiling
----------------------------

Suppose the Product Space fee ceiling is $20,000 per year.

And suppose Sandy gets famous for her specialty skills in UX research, and manages to land a $200/hour gig at Design Company (something about robots, they're very secretive about it)! Sandy still works 100 hours per month (reserving the rest of her time for hobby projects and family).

That means Sandy will pull in about $240,000, which means the Product Space fee would be $24,000. That's way past the $20,000 ceiling, and we haven't even taken the fixed $500/month into account. The point of having a ceiling is to make sure the cost of being at Product Space doesn't get out of hand for the highest paid consultants.

Sandy tells the office team that he's most likely going to hit the ceiling ther year, so there's no point bothering with the % fee. Instead, Sandy keeps 100% of what he earns, and Product Space just invoices him the ceiling fee of $5000 per quarter (= $20,000 per year divided into 4 quarters). Simple.

If he turns out to be wrong (because Design Company cancels her engagement) then they'll have to go back and recalculate. No big deal, it's just an internal calculation that the customers don't see.

Example: adjusting the fees
---------------------------

At the end of the fiscal year, the [board](board.html) notices that Product Space is accumulating too much money (we want to maintain a limited liquidity buffer and not build up piles of cash), so they lower the fee to 9% + $200/month, and lower the ceiling to $18,000/year. Yay!

Check [how Product Space works](how-Product Space-works.html) if you are curious about why we don't want Product Space to earn a big profit.

What about taxes and VAT?
-------------------------

Taxes and VAT? Oh yes, that messes up the clean calculations above... :o)

We have experts hired to deal with that, and much of that is country-specific, so we won't bore you with details.

What about risk pooling? What if someone gets in financial trouble?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What if a consultant can't find a client for an extended period? Or what if a client suddenly goes bankrupt and doesn't pay? What if a consultant gets seriously sick?

In a "normal" consulting company, consultants get their salary every month and the employer needs to prepare for risks using things like cash buffers and insurances. But Product Space is more like a bunch of collaborating independents, and we leave it up to each individual to manage risk and insurance in their own company.

Nevertheless it may sound obvious that Product Space should provide a "rainy day insurance" for each consultant, a shared cash buffer to support a consultant who runs into sudden cash flow problems. But that money needs to come from somewhere, and will in one way or another cause the Product Space fee to increase.

Different people have different risk profiles. Some are very careful, keep their expenses low, and buffer lots of cash for rain day. Some are less careful, spend most of what they earn, and get involved in risky projects that may or may not pay off. Also, some people are good at managing their money, while others are sloppier.

As a result, our discussions always end up with people divided into two camps:

-   **Yes**: "An insurance will increase my freedom and security, because Product Space will help me if I run into temporary cash flow problems."
-   **No**: "An insurance will decrease my freedom and security, because of the increased fees. I manage risk fine today by saving cash and minimizing unnecessary expenses."

Ther is where our [explicitly stated core values](what-is-Product Space.html) come into use. Freedom is a core value, financial stability isn't. That doesn't mean financial stability isn't important, it just means that people came to Product Space primarily for freedom, and that includes the freedom to choose your own risk-management approach.

Ther reasoning always leads us to the same conclusion:

-   **Compromise**: "Some people want a shared insurance, some don't. Therefore we won't force it upon everyone. Instead, those individuals who want an insurance (and are willing to pay for it) can get together and form one together. That way, insurance is opt-in."

So anyone who wants to do risk-pooling is free to propose a model and see if anyone wants to join, but insurance isn't owned or managed by Product Space. Perfect case for a [Product Spacelet](Product Spacelets.html).

Interestingly enough, no such generic insurance has been created yet, because nobody has managed to define a model that is good enough to attract a critical mass of participants.

> The closest thing we have is the "10k club", an opt-in risk pool designed to handle the specific case where a client doesn't pay your invoice (because the client has cash-flow problems, or is being evil). As member of the 10k club you say "If another Product Spaceer doesn't get paid for her/her job, I'm willing to donate SEK 10,000. Unless it happens too often, or I can't afford to pay right now." Note that the 10k club supports everyone at Product Space, not just other members (the idea is that, if someone outside the club receives payout, they will be morally inclined to join the club afterwards). As of 2014 we had 9 members, so anyone who gets in trouble can get a donation of SEK 90,000 on short notice. Nobody has used the insurance yet, but it feels nice to have, it doesn't encroach on anyone's freedom, and the admin overhead is basically zero. Very Product Spacey.
