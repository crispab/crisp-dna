What is this?
=============

This site is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) site describing how Crisp works and why.

[Crisp](https://www.crisp.se) is a consulting company based in Stockholm, Sweden. But we aren't a very typical consulting company. For example:

-   None of the ~30 consultants are actually employed by {{ site.company_name }}.
-   We have no managers, not even a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organization and transparency. Almost everything is bottom-up, and [anyone can drive any decision](decisions.html).
-   Crisp's main purpose is to enable consultants to be happy, and [Crisp Happiness Index](happiness-index.html) is our driving metric. Strong revenue and delighted customers are a side effect, not a goal.
-   Crisp doesn't want to earn money from it's consultants. It is in practice a non-profit company (although not formally so). Consultants [keep most of what they earn](economic-model.html).
-   Our [ownership model](ownership-model.html) is designed to keep our stock financially worthless. There is no incentive to "cash in".
-   Consultants are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want (as long as they don't hurt the brand or [our house](what-is-crisp.html)), and work as much or as little as they want.

We get a lot of questions about how this works in practice, especially from other consultants looking to create something similar. After many years of experimenting we've converged on a model that works well, basically the sweet spot between being an independent consultant and being an employee. So we decided to [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) it.

Why open-source the Crisp DNA?
------------------------------

-   To make the world a better place! The model has helped us be happy and make a positive impact in the world, and publishing it may help others do the same.
-   Open-sourcing it is a fun social experiment, we're curious about what's going to happen :o)
-   By making our model public, we're more likely to keep it up-to-date and improve it as we learn.
-   Putting it on GitHub makes it easier for others to clone and evolve the model, and we can learn from that.
