Crisp Core
==================

Crisp Core is a collection of basic services that all Crispers get.

Included services:

* Invoicing
* Insurance coverage
* Marketing and brand building
* Access to a shared office
* A part of something bigger than the sum of all parts

The base Crisp fee covers these services.

The idea behind having Core services and is that we want a shared base of services, but we don't want everything to be mandatory.
We want the freedom to select which services we want to have, and only pay for what we use. 
Additional services are optional and offered as so-called [Crisplets](crisplets.html).
